So far, our team has worked towards our goal by distributing food blankets, and masks to those in need, as well as hand sanitizers due to the ongoing pandemic. We have also interviewed and shared the experiences through our social media presences of those who support the less fortunate, in the hopes of educating others on the severity of homelessness in Toronto, and encouraging them to support the people in their community.
