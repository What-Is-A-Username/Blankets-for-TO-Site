So this is quite a long story, but I'll do my best to give it to you in a few sentences.

It's very wealthy. There are so many places, so many people in this city, but unfortunately these problems still exist in our society. And that's why we really wanna take an initiative to start Blankets for T.O. and we actually started it through research. We looked into the best ways to support people that are homeless and we found that one of the best ways that we could do this as students would be through advocacy and through donating blankets specifically. Blankets, of course, because they're warm, they're durable.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:03:18] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\":\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\" \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"And we were also thinking of thermal blankets specifically because they're reflective and they're very heat efficient.

And that's also initially what drew me through the club. When I first joined the University of Toronto, just the initiative really resonated with me. And a second thing that drew me was the name. I found the name really catchy. I think it has a ring to it. So I think my next question is: \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"where did the name come from\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"?¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:04:36] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Naman\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": Yeah, sure. That's actually a good question. Some people might think that it didn't take us that long just because we started with ‚ÄúBlankets‚Äù, but we actually spent a lot of time, like Rushil said, we did a lot of research, so that was one of the things we spent a lot of time on because we wanted people to really know our motive and raise awareness through our name as well.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:04:51] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Naman\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": Since we were, you know, three high school students at the time even before university we wanted to get our name known right then and there instead of us explaining it to them. So, we started with Blankets for Toronto just because we were situated in Toronto and then we started with ‚ÄúBlankets‚Äù. So, we were like, you know what, let's start with ‚ÄúBlankets for Toronto‚Äù. If we want to change in the future, we'll change in the future. But then, as years went by, um, we got a lot of support from university students, from adults, from community members and, like you said, it has a ring to it and now it turned from Blankets from Toronto into BTO. Sometimes even ‚ÄúBlankets‚Äù.

And it got to our hearts and we knew we needed to do something about it.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:06:22] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Nimit\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And I think for all three of us, we've just been raised in this way.

And yes, it's been about two and a half years since we've started working on this, but it's, it's just been the best journey of our lives and it's the best project we've ever worked on.

I can really tell how passionate you guys are about it. And I guess when passion comes, things just become a bit easier. And I really like how you said that it came to you rather than you finding it. And I feel when you work towards something for a noble cause, challenges also come to you. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"So I think my next question is: what are some challenges that you guys faced as a team and how did these challenges help you?\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:08:14] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": I think we faced too many challenges to count, to be quite honest with you. Uh, there were just so many different barriers that presented themselves, but I'll talk about just a few that were quite important? The first one was definitely COVID in the pandemic and the lockdowns. We actually started back in September of 2019. That was our official start date for Blankets for T.O. at the University of Toronto. As you know, soon after, by the time March rolled around (March of 2020), that's when the pandemic hit. That's when university closed. And when we started off, we really just wanted to donate items blankets specifically to those that were in need on the streets.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:08:04] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And since so many places were closed and we didn't want to risk infecting these individuals with COVID-19, potentially. We didn't want to take that risk of going outside and talking to people and donating these items. So that really put a halt on our operations, our main goal.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:08:22] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And of course, it was also very de-motivating at times because we really just wanted to help these people. And there was no way we could do it because of COVID. However, despite that challenge, we persisted. We tried our best to find ways that we could address the homelessness crisis without focusing on our main goal at the moment.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:08:37] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And that's when we turned to advocacy, advocacy from social media. And that's when we started to grow our platform on Instagram to the current wonderful 2000 followers we have. We are very grateful to how much it's grown so far and the different projects we've been undertaking. But that's when another challenge manifested in the form of these individuals who endorsed these pervasive stereotypes surrounding homelessness.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:08:59] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": We actually encountered people, seniors in our community, who believed that homeless individuals were simply drug addicts and they would only be using the money and the supplies they were given to purchase drugs and other illegal substances in our community.

And the primary way we found of doing this was through our Motivation Mondays. I'm sure those of you who follow Blankets for T.O. have definitely seen these. They've transformed from posts to reels and we're very proud of the progression it has made. Essentially Motivation Mondays are all about highlighting those in our community, celebrities, those who are famous, who have helped the homeless, who have performed these acts of kindness. And ultimately this is done to inspire those to recognize that yes, so many people support the idea of eradicating homelessness. It's an important issue that needs to be dealt with, needs to be solved. So that's the primary method with which we advocate.

And I really like how you guys kind of became stronger after those challenges.

So as Naman said, we started in high school and in high school, the problem we had was what you mentioned earlier, that the more the messier, and we had too many chefs or cooks in the kitchen. And we learned that lesson and we saw that having too many people in the start is not something that's ideal for an organization that's just starting off.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:13:19] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Nimit\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": For some background, in our first year at BTO, we started with six members or six executive members. And now our team is 20 people and next year will be even bigger. So throughout this evolution of BTO, we've been able to see our leadership styles change. When we were only six people we really had to get down and dirty, really, with all the things we had to do, because we had to be involved in every single thing, just sort of micromanaging because we didn't have any other choice.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:13:47] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Nimit\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": We learned how to take on those positions and do the work that was necessary, even though we were co-founders and we were co-presidents, it was the same thing. We were, essentially, every single position. And I think that was a really good learning experience because it taught us how to be every single position and then such a big organization, especially for people who are premedical students, and they want to go into medicine, but we were learning about a completely different field in philanthropy and the nonprofit side of things.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:14:15] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Nimit\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": But then that completely changed this year when we have 20 people now, and this is a completely different dynamic because now we have other people for specific tasks and our job is to lead and direct the actual direction of BTO and not just those little small things. We have to choose which way we want to go, and that has also been a good learning experience. It puts a lot more responsibility and accountability on our hands. We've just been trying to improve every single day, take the feedback from our team and just become better leaders every single day and also develop good leaders in the team because we're very open to also following when other people want to lead. And you wanted to lead this podcast and you've done an amazing job. And we're really happy about that.

There are so many different things that we could talk about when it comes to the community and homelessness. But really what we want people to understand is that while it may not be in everyone's capacity to help someone who is homeless, for example you may not be able to donate items, donate money, or even volunteer, whether it's for Blankets for T.O. or another charity or organization that supports homelessness, what's really important is that we do start having conversations. We do start raising awareness about the problem. And the key to the matter is that the more people that know about this issue, the more people that are aware that homelessness is a real crisis in Toronto and Scarborough, the more likely it is that people will help, the more likely it is that people will change their mindsets.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:16:44] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": So, we're really looking for people to have these conversations, really just have an open mindset to the different possibilities and different experiences that people can have in their lives and why they can end up in this way. For example, there are so many different reasons why people can be homeless, whether it be the rising housing costs currently because of COVID-19 or even with the gas prices, they‚Äôve been skyrocketing because of multiple things that are going on in our world currently. So there are just so many different ways, so many different things we can think about, so many different perspectives we can take. So at least keeping that open mindset when it comes to homelessness, I believe will definitely go a long way in making sure these people have a home eventually, are supported by our community, and feel welcome as well.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:17:26] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Zaynab\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": Definitely. And with all because of the pandemic, and as you mentioned, the housing prices are on a rise. It's just been so hard for even people like us to just imagine people who have been victims of these systematic failures, and that is also something we will be discussing in our next episode, which I'll briefly touch on towards the end.

It is all on our website. To put it into simpler terms, Rushil mentioned that we just want people to not have a negative stigma, not judge people, and focus on how to help people and stay on the surface level: People don't need to think about the internal factors related to someone who is sitting on the street or needs something. I think our first response should be to go and help the person instead of making judgments about the person.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:18:30] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Naman\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And second, would be to get involved in organizations like ours now.

I feel like, besides the donations and everything, I think the most important thing is just awareness. And I think Rushil mentioned this earlier that it's kind of crazy if you think about it, that even people in our community, specifically the U of T community, have some negative stigmas regarding homelessness.

That's a hard question to answer because there've been so many. Right. But I'd say the most rewarding for any of us, anyone at BTO who's been to donation can say why it's so rewarding, but it's because just when you look at the smile on the faces, of the homeless individuals, when you give them a care package with 10 items and it shows them that you're caring for them: that's just the best feeling. I can give you an example. People can also see this on our Instagram. Recently, we went out in November about, and we gave out donations of the care packages to people in downtown Toronto. And there was an individual who was a South Korean war veteran. And he was homeless because after he came to Canada, the SARS pandemic in 2003 happened and he lost his restaurant and he's been homeless since 2003. That's just crazy in such a big city where there are so many resources. And because we were able to talk to him and because we were able to give him something, he was able to smile a little and God knows when that happened the last time. So we're just trying to put smiles on faces.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:21:15] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Nimit\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": In the meantime, it's also really rewarding to see what we're doing, our work, is being recognized because that's what really matters. We need to address the root causes. And I'd say that two really big things that have happened with us are especially being recognized by MPs (Members of Parliament) because we've been recognized by five or six and they know what we're doing is impactful. And if we can influence them to make changes in the House of Commons, that's the best thing we could do because we need to make systematic changes, not just handle blankets. So, yes, just going out is the most rewarding, but also getting recognized for what we've done.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:21:51] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Zaynab\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": No, yeah, that's amazing. And the thing with MPs recognizing BTO is the fact that their audience gets exposure to what BTO does as well, which is just something so important. Maybe someone out there just gets inspired by what BTO is doing and starts their own thing. So again, it raises awareness, which is what you guys are striving to do. So, yeah, that's amazing. And I know so far we've been talking about what BTO has done and is doing, but I think our audience would also be interested to know any BTO future plans. I think Naman mentioned other BTO chapters. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"So Rushil, do you want to get into a bit of the BTO future and what it looks like?\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:22:30] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": Absolutely. And, what I'm going to do ‚Äì we have a lot of plans, we're very ambitious ‚Äì but I'm going to leave a few of them for a little bit of a secret so our audience and everyone can maybe expect those announcements to come very soon in the near future. But I'll talk about a few of the ones that we're very excited to share. So Naman did talk about the BTO chapters. We're very excited to say that. We're gonna be expanding Blankets for T.O. across, hopefully Ontario for now, but we're gonna try to expand across Canada hopefully. So currently ‚Äì of course this isn‚Äôt an exhaustive list ‚Äì we have a York University chapter. We've got a University of Toronto downtown campus chapter. We've also got an OTU chapter in Oshawa at Ontario Tech University. We've got a Hamilton chapter for McMaster, a Western chapter in London. So we've just had a multitude of different chapters we've currently opened. And our aim is to really expand the reach of Blankets for T.O. and hopefully address homelessness in these communities as well, because of course, homelessness is a global issue and we want to reach as many people as we can.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:23:36] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And in terms of another future plan that we're going to be sharing very soon: it's actually that we're planning on revamping our reward system that we currently have for our members. So currently, if you are a BTO member, you can enjoy a plethora of different rewards for engaging with our activities. For example, eventually you can actually win an AirPods Pro if you are able to participate in our activities enough and really engage with us. We're planning on revamping that reward system very soon, so if you guys are planning on becoming members hopefully next year or over the summer, you can expect to enjoy those benefits.¬†\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"[00:24:13] \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"italic\"}],\"value\":\"Rushil\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\": And finally, in terms of a final future plan that I'd like to share, it is really just upcoming donations in the sense that we want to hopefully strive for increasing that number that we're currently at. We're currently sitting at around 5,000 items or so, or 5,000 or beyond. While I'm not too much of a numbers person and I don't like to look at the numbers a lot, it's just something that's very, very, very amazing to see because we've come so far. And hopefully by the end of the year or in the near future, we're going to be surpassing 10,000 items donated to various different homeless shelters, as well as those on the streets. I'm very much looking forward to when we reach that very big milestone for our organization. So those are just a few of the plans I want to share.
