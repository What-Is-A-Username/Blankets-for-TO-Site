However, there is one community that has been the most affected, but is often overlooked - the homeless. Homelessness was already on the rise since before the pandemic, but ever since late 2019, homelessness rates have risen dramatically. It was reported that during the harsh winters of January 2021, there were an additional \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"30,000\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\" cases of bankruptcy and homelessness reported.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"Every year, an estimated 235,000 Canadians find themselves homeless. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"These Canadians are among the most vulnerable, with no practical option to adopt social distancing in order to avoid contracting COVID-19, which adds to the list of reasons why homelessness is a national emergency.

While most people advocate for the increase of shelters for the homeless during these harsh times, Dr. Andrew Boozary, the Executive Director of Social Medicine at the University Health Network says otherwise. According to him, the air circulation and living conditions of these shelters are extremely formidable, and it would be better for the homeless community to take refuge in tents. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"One of the solutions to this problem is the potential increase in hotel recovery sites being set up in some municipalities. According to Boozary, housing and health go hand in hand as providing appropriate separated refuge has become a mandate in such conditions. Another important part of bridging this gap is to make homeless people feel welcome by creating trust between them and the communities that assist them, and that is exactly what we strive to do here at Blankets for Toronto.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}","references":[]},"articleType":"Article","publishDate":"February 6th, 2022","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Homelessness has been on the rise since the pandemic, and it is time we shed some light on this community and try to raise their concerns.</p>","rawMarkdownBody":"Homelessness has been on the rise since the pandemic, and it is time we shed some light on this community and try to raise their concerns."}},"socialMediaLinkPreview":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/5rFyBNR7HoBsGk8UR9o6Ik/f52710daf084c006f1f0b647fa04cc92/Large_preview_image.jpg"}},"previewOnly":false}},"pageContext":{"slug":"impact-of-COVID-on-homelessness","previousPostSlug":"december-donations-downtown","nextPostSlug":"lhci-2022-bto-tote-bag-competition"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1305859228","1943705662","3261414115","964926838"]}
