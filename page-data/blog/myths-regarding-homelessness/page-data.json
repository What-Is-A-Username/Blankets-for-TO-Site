Another stereotype imposed on homeless people is them being criminals.  This mainly happens because most of the homeless’ daily activities are criminalized such as getting arrested for minor offences like trespassing, littering and loitering. The next big claim is that the homeless people chose this life because of their bad choices. We have all made mistakes at some point in our lives; however, the fall to homelessness comes more as a direct result of one losing their job, being a victim to an illness, experiencing an unfortunate accident, or falling into debt. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"We have all heard this one: “They just need to get a job”. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"A good portion of homeless people are working, but they simply cannot afford to pay rent. Moreover, most of the job listings require a stable housing, address and proper clothing, which makes getting a job much harder for the homeless. Another stereotype is that the homeless choose to live in unsanitary conditions . When people are conditioned to living outside, they are automatically in a place where there is no daily disposal for bodily functions, no set place to dispose of trash, nor containers to store food.  The last myth we will be discussing is the notion that there are plenty of services and support for the homeless. While this stands true, it only works in the short-term, there are individuals seeking long-term solutions to get out of the cycle of homelessness. It is integral we shed light on the need for more affordable housing and the need to confront the rising criminalization of homelessness which inhibits this community from receiving the permanent shelter that they need.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}","references":[{"description":"Artist's drawing of homeless person with sign","title":"Homeless person with sign","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=128&h=84&q=50&fm=webp 128w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=256&h=168&q=50&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=512&h=336&q=50&fm=webp 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=512&h=336&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=128&h=84&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 128w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=256&h=168&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs/318fdf83fc29f211ddbba1af2d407a5c/small-preview.jpg?w=512&h=336&fl=progressive&q=50&fm=jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","width":760,"height":499},"contentful_id":"QVrLqzBfqFzmNj6zP2Sbs"}]},"articleType":"Article","publishDate":"October 25th, 2021","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We discuss some common stereotypes revolving around the homeless community and debunk some major myths in the community.</p>","rawMarkdownBody":"We discuss some common stereotypes revolving around the homeless community and debunk some major myths in the community."}},"socialMediaLinkPreview":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/lure70awngxy/7t7wF1QQxJNFZyUwOetR3g/fff9fea273fb6d8804bb72e85d8cf825/preview.jpg"}},"previewOnly":false}},"pageContext":{"slug":"myths-regarding-homelessness","previousPostSlug":"january-blanket-drive-gofundme","nextPostSlug":"valentines-movie-night-2022"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1305859228","1943705662","3261414115","964926838"]}
