Among the most common reasons for trips reported visiting friends or family, accessing medical care, going to food pantries, commuting to and from shelters, and going for job searches and interviews [3,4]. The necessity of transport means that shelters benefit immensely from having good transit access. The need to assess and address the needs of this community, and other demographics suffering from poverty, has been recognized by numerous transit agencies and municipal departments. However, proper assessment of this group with traditional methods, such as surveys and record-keeping, proves uniquely difficult since some may lack a dedicated phone number or permanent address, and may move around numerous shelters or social services [5]. In surveys across American transit agencies, 73% believed that ridership is impacted by homelessness and 68% acknowledged responsibility in working with the homeless population [6]. Among the agencies surveyed, many cited a lack of funding for addressing the relevant issues appropriately [6]. \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}]},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"With regards to transit affordability, recommendations to government institutions to promote inclusiveness and equal opportunity have included the subsidization of fares, such as the one put forth in Minnesota [7].

In this dialogue, it is important to acknowledge that homeless individuals are not a monolithic group, as each will be varying personal challenges and unique sets of circumstances with regards to their financial situation, employment status, physical and mental health, and so forth. Thus, homeless individuals will utilize public transport infrastructure in different ways and would benefit from different methods of outreach. Studies in the UK, Germany and the United States have identified that a sizable portion of homeless individuals spend their nights on buses and trains, with many citing disagreement with shelter guidelines or lack of shelter availability [6]. If you are a Toronto resident, you may have seen homeless individuals resting in subway train carriages or in station corridors. Different agencies have tackled these occurrences differently. When we review approaches across North America, approaches can generally be categorized into punitive and outreach responses [6]. Punitive measures to homelessness on transit may involve a transit agency instructing workers to perform occasional sweeps to remove homeless individuals from transit areas or to order homeless individuals off of vehicles once they have reached the final stop [6]. These are made possible by the creation of local ordinances which may prohibit loitering and sleeping at transit stations, thus allowing authorities to give fines, make arrests and confiscate property [6]. To the same effect, agencies may also employ “hostile architecture” by deliberately designing seats and station surfaces to be uncomfortable to sleep on [6]. Critics argue that these approaches merely displace homelessness to other places by unfairly criminalizing and avoiding efforts to resolve it [6]. \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}]},{\"nodeType\":\"embedded-asset-block\",\"data\":{\"target\":{\"sys\":{\"id\":\"4fTnpJzGzD4zwhDRPoYar2\",\"type\":\"Link\",\"linkType\":\"Asset\"}}},\"content\":[]},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Not all measures are of a punitive nature, for there are outreach programs in place in various systems.

In Denver, social workers and clinicians accompany security staff when transit police identify riders in need [8].
