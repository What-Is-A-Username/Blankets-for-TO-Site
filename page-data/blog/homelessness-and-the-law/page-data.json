The imposed four-week overnight curfew saw Quebecers needing to stay home between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., with few exceptions. This included those who were experiencing homelessness, as Legault argued because of the cold, they should seek indoor shelter, and that “there is enough room available.\\\" Local advocates in the community, such as Nakuset, quickly spoke up in response to Legault’s comments, calling them “tone-deaf” for expecting homeless individuals to follow curfew. \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Not only do individuals experiencing homelessness have to endure the very condition of homelessness, but also the discriminatory nature of the law. Nakuset’s fears were that police would fine homeless people, because they would be breaking the curfew.
