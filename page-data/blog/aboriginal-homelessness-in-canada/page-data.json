The severe lack of care for Canada’s Indigenous Peoples is a key contributor to ongoing homelessness in their communities. This also highlights the ways in which intersectionality plays a significant part in someone’s life. Social and societal issues impact people in different ways, and taking into consideration these multiple perspectives and experiences faced by a racially marginalized population aids society when discussing ways in which to help these unique communities.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"References","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"heading-3"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Patrick, C.
