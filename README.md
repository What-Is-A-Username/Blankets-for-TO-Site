# Blankets for T.O. Website 
![Blankets for T.O. banner](static/bto_background.png)
This [website](https://blanketsforto.ca) was built for Blankets for T.O. (BTO), a non-profit organization founded in 2019 at the University of Toronto Scarborough which advocates for the homeless community in Toronto. Website code written by [@clwillhuang](https://github.com/clwillhuang), with incorporation of various external packages. The site was built upon the [gatsby-contentful-starter](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter) repository, utilizing Gatsby, Contentful and React.

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository with Git. 
2. Run `npm run setup` to perform setup of the needed environment variables for integration with Contentful.
3. If the Contentful space is **not yet setup**, such as if the space is new, run migrations by running `contentful space migration .\contentful\migrations\initial.js` to create the required content model on Contentful. **Otherwise**, if the space has already been setup with the appropriate content models, skip this step.
4. Run `npm run dev` to view the website in the browser.
